#### What I've learnt from this:
> scale and create reusable image classes. Through creating a class of imgbox which is positioned under the layout I want for the page. The image needed to be added in HTML so the classes could be reused.
 ``` css=
 .imgbox-inner {
  width: 100%;
  padding-top: 75%;
  position: relative;
}

.imgbox-inner .image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
  background-position: left;
}
 ```
